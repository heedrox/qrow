QROW - QR Over WIFI
===================

QROW is a system that intends to discover QR over WIFI.
The idea is to find places in which "QROWs" fly. You open your
mobile app, and catch those QROWs. 

The idea is to make it as simple as QR codes are. You find a QROW, 
and it takes you where it is supposed to take you.

The same idea here: you find a QROW that remains in a WIFI, and it takes
you to whatever service, page, ... lives inside that WIFI.

QROWs are multicasted from a QROWServer. QROWReceivers just catch QROWs 
and shows them to the user. The user selects the QROW who wants to read.

QROWs can be used as a very SIMPLE system for services and pages discovery
in a local zone.
